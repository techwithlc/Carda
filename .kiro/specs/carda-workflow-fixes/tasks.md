# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Enhance generic response detection in Adaptive Response Generator

  - Implement more aggressive pattern matching for generic phrases like "可以考慮以下幾張", "表現突出的選擇"
  - Add detection for responses with multiple cards but no specific benefits
  - Create length-based detection for responses over 200 characters with generic content
  - Add vague language detection for terms like "可以考慮", "表現突出" without specifics
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 2. Improve card database with specific store and promotion data

  - Add specific store cashback rates for 7-11, 家樂福, momo, PChome to card data structure
  - Include current promotional offers with expiration dates for each card
  - Add target audience and application requirement fields to card objects
  - Update cashback rate categories to include online, digital, and specific merchant rates
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.5, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 3. Implement enhanced card matching algorithm

  - Create weighted scoring system that prioritizes specific store mentions over general categories
  - Add bonus scoring for exact store name matches (7-11, 家樂福, momo)
  - Implement fallback scoring to ensure at least one card is always recommended
  - Add logic to prefer single best-match card over multiple generic suggestions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 4. Create fallback recommendation generator

  - Build function to generate specific card recommendations when AI response is generic
  - Include card name, specific benefits, cashback rates, and promotional offers
  - Add logic to match user requirements to card features and generate targeted explanations
  - Implement different response styles based on user experience level (beginner/expert)
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 5.2_

- [-] 5. Enhance context resolution for follow-up questions

  - Implement reference resolution for phrases like "那張卡", "這個", "剛才提到的"
  - Add conversation history parsing to identify previously mentioned cards
  - Create comparison logic when user asks about differences between cards
  - Add progressive disclosure to provide more details on follow-up questions
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 6. Add response quality validation and metrics

  - Create response quality scoring based on specificity, relevance, and completeness
  - Add validation to ensure responses include card names, benefits, and rates
  - Implement logging of response quality metrics for monitoring
  - Add fallback triggers when response quality score is below threshold
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 7. Improve error handling and user guidance

  - Enhance error messages to provide specific examples of how to ask for recommendations
  - Add clarifying questions when user intent is unclear
  - Create helpful fallback responses when AI service fails
  - Implement graceful degradation with offline card recommendations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Test and validate workflow improvements
  - Create test cases for generic response detection accuracy
  - Test card matching algorithm with various user input scenarios
  - Validate context resolution with follow-up question examples
  - Test error handling with simulated service failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 5.1_
