# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Carda credit card assistant workflow needs improvements to provide specific, personalized credit card recommendations instead of generic responses. The current workflow generates repetitive content and fails to deliver actionable credit card suggestions to users in LINE chat.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a LINE chat user, I want to receive specific credit card recommendations with clear benefits and features, so that I can make informed decisions about which card to apply for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks for credit card recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide specific card names with detailed benefits
2. WHEN a user mentions spending categories (dining, overseas, shopping) THEN the system SHALL recommend cards optimized for those categories
3. WHEN a user asks about high cashback cards THEN the system SHALL provide cards with specific cashback percentages
4. WHEN a user requests free annual fee cards THEN the system SHALL recommend cards with zero annual fees
5. IF a user asks about specific stores (7-11, 家樂福, momo) THEN the system SHALL recommend cards with bonuses for those merchants

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to avoid receiving repetitive or generic responses, so that each interaction provides unique value and progresses the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates generic language patterns THEN the system SHALL replace them with specific recommendations
2. WHEN the response contains multiple card listings without specifics THEN the system SHALL focus on one best-match card
3. WHEN the response exceeds 200 characters with generic content THEN the system SHALL condense to key information
4. IF the AI response contains phrases like "可以考慮以下幾張" THEN the system SHALL generate a targeted recommendation instead

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to understand my follow-up questions and references to previous conversations, so that I can have natural, contextual discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user says "那張卡" or "這個" THEN the system SHALL reference the previously mentioned card
2. WHEN a user asks follow-up questions THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context
3. WHEN a user asks for comparisons THEN the system SHALL compare specific cards mentioned in conversation history
4. IF conversation history exists THEN the system SHALL use it to provide contextual responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive up-to-date and accurate credit card information, so that my decisions are based on current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing card recommendations THEN the system SHALL include current cashback rates and benefits
2. WHEN mentioning annual fees THEN the system SHALL provide accurate fee information
3. WHEN describing card features THEN the system SHALL include relevant promotional offers
4. IF card information changes THEN the system SHALL reflect updated data in responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the workflow to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful fallbacks, so that users always receive helpful responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI service fails THEN the system SHALL provide a helpful error message with alternative suggestions
2. WHEN the response is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL generate a fallback recommendation
3. WHEN the intent detection fails THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions
4. IF the user input is unclear THEN the system SHALL provide examples of how to ask for recommendations
